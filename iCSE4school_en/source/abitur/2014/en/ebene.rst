.. admonition:: Problem

  Given the plane :math:`E:3x_2+4x_3=5`,

  a) explain the special location of the plane :math:`E` in the coordinate
     system.

  b) verify by calculation whether a sphere with center :math:`Z(1|6|3)` and
     radius :math:`7` intersects the plane :math:`E`.

**Solution of part a**

The equation for the plane is independent of the :math:`x_1`-component. Therefore,
the plane :math:`E` is aligned parallel to the :math:`x_1`-axis.

We can use Sage to depict the plane in three dimensions by solving the plane's
equation for :math:`x_3`.

.. sagecellserver::

  sage: var('x1')
  sage: var('x2')
  sage: var('x3')
  sage: solution = solve(3*x2+4*x3 == 5, x3, solution_dict=1)[0]
  sage: p1 = plot3d(solution[x3], (x1, -10, 10), (x2, -10, 10))
  sage: p1

.. end of output

**Solution of part b**

First, we will use Sage to get an overview of the problem.

.. sagecellserver::

  sage: p2 = sphere(center=(1, 6, 3), size=7, color='red', opacity=1)
  sage: show(p1 + p2, aspect_ratio=1)

.. end of output

It is easy to see that the sphere and the plane intersect.

In order to analytically verify this observation, we will determine the distance
between the plane and the center of the sphere. The normal vector of the plane
can be derived from its Hesse normal form:

.. math::

  \vec{n} = \left( \begin{matrix}
    			0\\
    			3\\
    			4
  	     	    \end{matrix} \right),

or in normalized form:

.. math::

  \vec{n}_0 = \left( \begin{matrix}
    			0\\
    			\frac{3}{5}\\
    			\frac{4}{5}
  	     	    \end{matrix} \right).

In order to calculate the distance between the plane and the center of the
sphere, we define points along the line aligned parallel to the normal
:math:`\vec{n}_0` and going through the center of the sphere as

.. math::

  \left( \begin{matrix}
    			x_1\\
    			x_2\\
    			x_3
  	     	    \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix}
    			1\\
    			6\\
    			3
  	     	    \end{matrix} \right) + t\cdot \left( \begin{matrix}
    			0\\
    			\frac{3}{5}\\
    			\frac{4}{5}
  	     	    \end{matrix} \right).

The value of :math:`|t|` corresponds to the distance of the current point from the
center of the sphere. The value :math:`t` of the intersection point of the line
and the plane can be determined by inserting the coordinates of the line into
the plane's equation. We find

.. math::

  &3 \cdot \left(6+\frac{3}{5}t\right) + 4 \cdot \left(3+\frac{4}{5}t\right)-5
  =0 \quad\Leftrightarrow\\
  &t=-5 \quad\Leftrightarrow\\
  &|t|=5.

Thus, the distance between the plane and the center of the sphere equals 5 
and is smaller than the radius 7 of the sphere. Therefore, the 
sphere intersects the plane. The calculation can be verified by Sage:

.. sagecellserver::

  sage: t = var('t')
  sage: n = vector([0, 3, 4])
  sage: n0 = n/norm(n)
  sage: z = vector([1, 6, 3])
  sage: radius = 7
  sage: line = z+t*n0
  sage: solution = solve(3*line[1]+4*line[2] == 5, t, solution_dict=True)[0]
  sage: distance = abs(solution[t])
  sage: print "Distance: center of the sphere - plane:", distance
  sage: if distance < radius:
  ...       print('plane intersects sphere')
  sage: else:
  ...       print('plane does not intersect sphere')

.. end of output
