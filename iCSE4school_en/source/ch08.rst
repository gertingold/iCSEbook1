  Shape of surface
 
In the chemistry lab, for the separation of sludge substances sparingly, we have to used a device called a centrifuge. One example of a centrifuge is the vessel in which the slurry stored in the container set on the rotary disc around its own axis.

Problem to be solved:
Find the shape of the liquid surface (using the force analysis methode and by drawing the graph), which determines in a beaker of a 20 cm diameter, rotating around its axis of symmetry with the angular speed equals 12 radians per second.
 
Sugestion of solution:
Select the frame of reference in which we want to solve our problem:

   
.. sagecellserver::

  p=2 #change p
  for n in range(1,6): #change a range
    p=0.5*(p+2/p)
    print p
    print "error =",abs(N(sqrt(2)-p))
  
We've used a square-root algorithm (which is based on Newton's method for finding zeros of a function, this case is known as Babylonian method):  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method Perhaps you should change p and a range?

And what's interesting?
Let's try to transform a formula that has :math:`\sqrt{2}`, for instance

.. math::

  \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}+1}\right)^3.

Everyone has heard about the transformation of expressions that contain numbers that are not rational, so let's get to the tedious work...

.. math::

  \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}+1}\right)^3=\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}+1}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}-1}\right)^3=\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^6,


but

.. math::

  \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^6=\left(\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^2\right)^3=\left(3-2\sqrt{2}\right)^3,
  
and  

.. math::

  \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^6=\left(\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^3\right)^2=\left(5\sqrt{2}-7\right)^2,

and finally

.. math::

  \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^6=\left(5\sqrt{2}-7\right)^2=99-70\sqrt{2}.
  
Let

.. math::

  w_1=99-70\sqrt{2},\quad w_2=\left(5\sqrt{2}-7\right)^2,\quad w_3=\left(3-2\sqrt{2}\right)^3,\quad w_4=\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)^6,\quad w_5=\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}+1}\right)^3.

Of course :math:`w_1=w_2=w_3=w_4=w_5`, but: are there any difference among :math:`w_1,\dots,w_5` when we approach the square-root of two? Let's see...
We'll assume that the square root of two is equal to :math:`1.44` and you should change this value. 

.. sagecellserver::

  p=1.44     #change p, don't forget about sqrt(2)
  print 'apr=',p
  print 'w_1=',N(99-70*p)
  print 'w_2=',N((5*p-7)^2)
  print 'w_3=',N((3-2*p)^3)
  print'w_4=',N((p-1)^6)
  print 'w_5=',N(((p-1)/(p+1))^3)
  
It turns out that the differences among approximations are big, if we accept the square-root of two as :math:`1.41` (and yet many people think of approximations only to parts hundredths). What about the approximations we got by Babylonian method above? Try them!

The differences are large, what we can see, considering graphs related functions connected with :math:`w_1,\dots,w_5`. 

.. sagecellserver::

  @interact
  def _(xlimits=range_slider(0.5, 2.5, 0.1, default=(0.5, 2.5), label="horizontal range"),
      ylimits=range_slider(-10, 10, 0.1, default=(-10, 10), label="vertical range")):
    plt = plot(99-70*x, xlimits, color="red")
    plt = plt+plot((5*x-7)^2, xlimits, color="blue")
    plt = plt+plot((3-2*x)^3, xlimits, color="green")
    plt = plt+plot((x-1)^6, xlimits, color="orange")
    plt = plt+plot(((x-1)/(x+1))^3, xlimits, color="purple")
    show(plt, xmin=xlimits[0], xmax=xlimits[1], ymin=ylimits[0], ymax=ylimits[1], figsize=(4, 3))
  
**At the end** we go to ``sqrt(2)``.
  
:math:`\verb+sqrt(2)+=\sqrt{2}\quad\textrm{ or }\quad\verb+sqrt(2)+\approx\sqrt{2}?`

Is not that strange?
