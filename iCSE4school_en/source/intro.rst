Introduction
------------








The project iCSE4school was implemented in international
cross-sectoral cooperation involving 3 higher education institutions,
2 post-gymnasium schools and one non-governmental organization related
to the education sector. The project was realized in the period
01.09.2014 to 31.08.2017.

The main objective of the project was to develop a methodology
integrating computer science with mathematics and physics in
post-gymnasium schools on the basis of the pilot program. The goal was
realized by introducing innovative teaching methods in mathematics,
physics and computer science using Python / SAGE programming. 

The implementation of the project was partly based on the exchange of
good transnational practices related to education and the use of peer
learning and learning by doing methods.  A key role in the project was
the coordination of computer science with the physics and mathematics
curriculum for enhancing students' knowledge and skills in the field
of computational perspectives (Methods of visualization such as
function plotting, numerical methods, computer algebra,
and data processing. Unlike many other educational computerization
solutions, the project uses interactive learning based on Python and
SageMath.


During the project students and teachers from two highschools worked
on SageMath servers. They have created almost 3000 documents, some of
them have been "published" and can be viewed:
